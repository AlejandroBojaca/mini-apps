# Mini Apps Repository
Welcome to my Mini Apps Repository! This collection showcases a variety of small projects and scripts developed in different programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, Python, Docker, and more. Each mini app is designed to help practice coding skills, experiment with new concepts, and reinforce learning across various domains.

## Contents
JavaScript: Scripts and small web-based applications to practice frontend and backend development.
Python: Automation scripts, data processing tasks, and small projects to enhance Python proficiency.
Docker: Containerized environments and applications to explore Docker and containerization practices.
Other: Miscellaneous projects and experiments using different technologies and frameworks.
## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my coding journey, explore new ideas, and build a strong foundation in various programming paradigms. It's a playground for learning, problem-solving, and improving my coding ability.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the projects, run the code, and even contribute by suggesting improvements or adding your own mini apps!

## Contribution
If you have ideas or improvements, contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
